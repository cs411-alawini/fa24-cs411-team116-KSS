Project Summary:
Every day, a random UIUC class will be selected as the class of the day. Users will be able to guess UIUC classes until they get it right. After each incorrect guess, the app will reveal what was right and what was wrong with the guess. For example, the guess might have the correct department but the wrong amount of credits, a lower course number, or different general education categories. Once the user has successfully guessed the class of the day, a summary of the class will be displayed so that users can learn more about the wide variety of offerings on campus. There will also be an endless mode where users can continue to guess random classes after they have correctly identified the class of the day. Users who create an account will be able to see statistics on their guesses, like their average number of guesses or most guessed class.
